\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:Problem-Statement}

Stress is one of the main causes for serious health diseases such as heart attacks. 
Because of this, there are stress monitors which monitor blood volume, pulse, emotions, and 
body temperature.  

The use of two popular classifiers, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), 
are used to help analyze the Wearable Stress and Addect Detection (WESAD) dataset \cite{dataset}. 
A comparison is then done to compare the performance of utilizing Central Processing Units (CPUs) and 
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Finally, a detailed analysis of benchmarks for each testing bed is 
provided to determine which method and platform performed the best.
