Stress can affect your health, your well-being and the quality of life. Stress affects the brain, but can stress damage the brain causing psychiatric disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and eating disorders? 

Another stress analysis, the Feminine Gender Role Stress (FGRS) scale was used to link women's eating disorders and stress.

Most of these women who suffer from these extreme stress levels have adapted to the traditional gender role or have severe body image issues.
